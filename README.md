# NiceList
NiceList is a Christmas Gift tracking solution for people who want all of their Christmas shopping in one centralized location. Users can view their entire progress at a glance, and see what gifts still need attention.


## About the User 
This app is designed for people who may struggle to remember where gifts are being shipped, who they are being shipped to, and what they still need to do to complete their Christmas shopping. NiceList helps the user keep all their information in one place, helping to streamline the process of Holiday shopping.

## Features 
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-out using Firebase authentication.
- **Dashboard**: Users can see overall progress for their Christmas shopping, progress per person, and the status of each gift, all in one centralized view.
- **Budget**: Users can create a budget for their Christmas shopping, and any gifts they purchase will automatically be deducted from that budget.
- **Gift Ideas**: Create a gift ideas list to remember good gift ideas throughout the year. Then when you're ready to shop, assign the gift ideas to people.
- **Gift Status**: Edit the status of a gift from the dashboard and see the gift status update in real time, including updating progress.
